		<p><h2>Hello! Welcome to the Fantasy Grounds module generator for DungeonFog</h2></p>
		<p>This page and the generator itself were coded in their entirety by Forecaster, for the benefit of the venn diagram overlap between DungeonFog users and Fantasy Grounds users (such as myself).</p>
		<p>You can get started right away by using the form below, or read on for more information!</p>
		<p>If, after reading the sections below, you need additional help, or want to report an issue, you can find Forecaster on the <a href="https://dungeonfog.com/discord">DungeonFog discord</a>. You can also report issues and submit feature requests on this projects <a href="https://github.com/Forecaster/UniversalVTTExport_to_FGModule">GitHub repository</a> (requires a GitHub account).</p>
		<p>On the GitHub page you can also find all the code associated with this project, which includes the parser and this page.</p>
		<h4>Features:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Import of map image</li>
			<li>Wall definitions for Line of Sight</li>
			<li>Toggle-able doors & windows</li>
		</ul>
