# UniversalVTTExport_to_FGModule

This is a parser written in Python that converts UniversalVTT exports from DungeonFog to Fantasy Grounds modules.

The generated modules are ready to load right into a Fantasy Grounds campaign and support line of sight.

This parser can be downloaded and run locally (assuming Python is installed) or used online on [this page](https://towerofawesome.org/df2uvtt/) where you can also find a more exhaustive description of the project (or check `MPC/usr/pages/default.php` in this repository).

A list of features is also available on said page. For support regarding this project submit an issue in this repository, or join the [DungeonFog discord server](https://dungeonfog.com/discord) and ask Forecaster.

When downloading the parser to run locally from this repository use `deployment/parser.py`, since it includes all necessary libraries.
